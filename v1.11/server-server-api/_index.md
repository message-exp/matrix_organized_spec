# Server-Server API


Matrix homeservers use the Federation APIs (also known as server-server
 APIs) to communicate with each other. Homeservers use these APIs to push
 messages to each other in real-time, to retrieve historic messages from
 each other, and to query profile and presence information about users on
 each other’s servers.


The APIs are implemented using HTTPS requests between each of the
 servers. These HTTPS requests are strongly authenticated using public
 key signatures at the TLS transport layer and using public key
 signatures in HTTP Authorization headers at the HTTP layer.


There are three main kinds of communication that occur between
 homeservers:


Persistent Data Units (PDUs):
 These events are broadcast from one homeserver to any others that have
 joined the same room (identified by Room ID). They are persisted in
 long-term storage and record the history of messages and state for a
 room.


Like email, it is the responsibility of the originating server of a PDU
 to deliver that event to its recipient servers. However PDUs are signed
 using the originating server’s private key so that it is possible to
 deliver them through third-party servers.


Ephemeral Data Units (EDUs):
 These events are pushed between pairs of homeservers. They are not
 persisted and are not part of the history of a room, nor does the
 receiving homeserver have to reply to them.


Queries:
 These are single request/response interactions between a given pair of
 servers, initiated by one side sending an HTTPS GET request to obtain
 some information, and responded by the other. They are not persisted and
 contain no long-term significant history. They simply request a snapshot
 state at the instant the query is made.


EDUs and PDUs are further wrapped in an envelope called a Transaction,
 which is transferred from the origin to the destination homeserver using
 an HTTPS PUT request.


## API standards


The mandatory baseline for server-server communication in Matrix is
 exchanging JSON objects over HTTPS APIs. More efficient transports may be
 specified in future as optional extensions.


All `POST` and `PUT` endpoints require the requesting server to supply a
 request body containing a (potentially empty) JSON object. Requesting servers
 should supply a `Content-Type` header of `application/json` for all requests
 with JSON bodies, but this is not required.


Similarly, all endpoints in this specification require the destination server
 to return a JSON object. Servers must include a `Content-Type` header of
 `application/json` for all JSON responses.
 


All JSON data, in requests or responses, must be encoded using UTF-8.


### TLS


Server-server communication must take place over HTTPS.


The destination server must provide a TLS certificate signed by a known
 Certificate Authority.


Requesting servers are ultimately responsible for determining the trusted Certificate
 Authorities, however are strongly encouraged to rely on the operating system’s
 judgement. Servers can offer administrators a means to override the trusted
 authorities list. Servers can additionally skip the certificate validation for
 a given whitelist of domains or netmasks for the purposes of testing or in
 networks where verification is done elsewhere, such as with `.onion`
 addresses.


Servers should respect SNI when making requests where possible: a SNI should be
 sent for the certificate which is expected, unless that certificate is expected
 to be an IP address in which case SNI is not supported and should not be sent.


Servers are encouraged to make use of the [Certificate
 Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) project.


### Unsupported endpoints


If a request for an unsupported (or unknown) endpoint is received then the server
 must respond with a 404 `M_UNRECOGNIZED` error.


Similarly, a 405 `M_UNRECOGNIZED` error is used to denote an unsupported method
 to a known endpoint.


## Server discovery


### Resolving server names


Each Matrix homeserver is identified by a server name consisting of a
 hostname and an optional port, as described by the
 [grammar](/v1.11/appendices#server-name). Where applicable, a delegated
 server name uses the same grammar.
 


Server names are resolved to an IP address and port to connect to, and
 have various conditions affecting which certificates and `Host` headers
 to send. The process overall is as follows:


1. If the hostname is an IP literal, then that IP address should be
 used, together with the given port number, or 8448 if no port is
 given. The target server must present a valid certificate for the IP
 address. The `Host` header in the request should be set to the
 server name, including the port if the server name included one.
2. If the hostname is not an IP literal, and the server name includes an
 explicit port, resolve the hostname to an IP address using CNAME, AAAA or A
 records.
 Requests are made to the resolved IP address and given port with a
 `Host` header of the original server name (with port). The target
 server must present a valid certificate for the hostname.
3. If the hostname is not an IP literal, a regular HTTPS request is
 made to `https://<hostname>/.well-known/matrix/server`, expecting
 the schema defined later in this section. 30x redirects should be
 followed, however redirection loops should be avoided. Responses
 (successful or otherwise) to the `/.well-known` endpoint should be
 cached by the requesting server. Servers should respect the cache
 control headers present on the response, or use a sensible default
 when headers are not present. The recommended sensible default is 24
 hours. Servers should additionally impose a maximum cache time for
 responses: 48 hours is recommended. Errors are recommended to be
 cached for up to an hour, and servers are encouraged to
 exponentially back off for repeated failures. The schema of the
 `/.well-known` request is later in this section. If the response is
 invalid (bad JSON, missing properties, non-200 response, etc), skip
 to step 4. If the response is valid, the `m.server` property is
 parsed as `<delegated_hostname>[:<delegated_port>]` and processed as
 follows:
 


	1. If `<delegated_hostname>` is an IP literal, then that IP address
	 should be used together with the `<delegated_port>` or 8448 if
	 no port is provided. The target server must present a valid TLS
	 certificate for the IP address. Requests must be made with a
	 `Host` header containing the IP address, including the port if
	 one was provided.
	2. If `<delegated_hostname>` is not an IP literal, and
	 `<delegated_port>` is present, an IP address is discovered by
	 looking up CNAME, AAAA or A records for `<delegated_hostname>`. The
	 resulting IP address is used, alongside the `<delegated_port>`.
	 Requests must be made with a `Host` header of
	 `<delegated_hostname>:<delegated_port>`. The target server must
	 present a valid certificate for `<delegated_hostname>`.
	3. **[Added in `v1.8`]** If
	 `<delegated_hostname>` is not an IP literal and no
	 `<delegated_port>` is present, an SRV record is looked up for
	 `_matrix-fed._tcp.<delegated_hostname>`. This may result in another
	 hostname (to be resolved using AAAA or A records) and port.
	 Requests should be made to the resolved IP address and port with
	 a `Host` header containing the `<delegated_hostname>`. The
	 target server must present a valid certificate for
	 `<delegated_hostname>`.
	4. **[Deprecated]** If `<delegated_hostname>` is not an IP literal, no
	 `<delegated_port>` is present, and a
	 `_matrix-fed._tcp.<delegated_hostname>`
	 SRV record was not found, an SRV record is looked up for
	 `_matrix._tcp.<delegated_hostname>`. This may result in another
	 hostname (to be resolved using AAAA or A records) and port.
	 Requests should be made to the resolved IP address and port with
	 a `Host` header containing the `<delegated_hostname>`. The
	 target server must present a valid certificate for
	 `<delegated_hostname>`.
	5. If no SRV record is found, an IP address is resolved using CNAME, AAAA
	 or A records. Requests are then made to the resolved IP address
	 and a port of 8448, using a `Host` header of
	 `<delegated_hostname>`. The target server must present a valid
	 certificate for `<delegated_hostname>`.
4. **[Added in `v1.8`]** If the `/.well-known` request
 resulted in an error response, a server is
 found by resolving an SRV record for `_matrix-fed._tcp.<hostname>`. This may
 result in a hostname (to be resolved using AAAA or A records) and
 port. Requests are made to the resolved IP address and port, with a `Host`
 header of `<hostname>`. The target server must present a valid certificate
 for `<hostname>`.
5. **[Deprecated]** If the `/.well-known` request resulted in an error response,
 and a `_matrix-fed._tcp.<hostname>` SRV record was not found, a server is
 found by resolving an SRV record for `_matrix._tcp.<hostname>`. This may
 result in a hostname (to be resolved using AAAA or A records) and
 port. Requests are made to the resolved IP address and port, with a `Host`
 header of `<hostname>`. The target server must present a valid certificate
 for `<hostname>`.
6. If the `/.well-known` request returned an error response, and
 no SRV records were found, an IP address is resolved using CNAME, AAAA and A
 records. Requests are made to the resolved IP address using port
 8448 and a `Host` header containing the `<hostname>`. The target
 server must present a valid certificate for `<hostname>`.



The reasons we require `<hostname>` rather than `<delegated_hostname>` for
 SRV
 delegation are:


1. DNS is insecure (not all domains have DNSSEC), so the target of the delegation
 must prove that it is a valid delegate for `<hostname>` via TLS.
2. Consistency with the recommendations in [RFC6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125#section-6.2.1)
 and other applications using SRV records such [XMPP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6120#section-13.7.2.1).




Note that the target of a SRV record may *not* be a CNAME, as
 mandated by [RFC2782](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2782.html):



> the name MUST NOT be an alias (in the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181)




Steps 3.4 and 5 are deprecated because they use a service name not registered by IANA.
 They may be removed in a future version of the specification. Server admins are encouraged
 to use `.well-known` over any form of SRV records.


The IANA registration for port 8448 and `matrix-fed` can be found [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=matrix-fed).

### Retrieving server keys



 There was once a “version 1” of the key exchange. It has been removed
 from the specification due to lack of significance. It may be reviewed
 [from
 the historical
 draft](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/51faf8ed2e4a63d4cfd6d23183698ed169956cc0/specification/server_server_api.rst#232version-1).
 
Each homeserver publishes its public keys under
 `/_matrix/key/v2/server`. Homeservers query for keys by either
 getting `/_matrix/key/v2/server` directly or by querying an
 intermediate notary server using a
 `/_matrix/key/v2/query/{serverName}` API. Intermediate notary
 servers query the `/_matrix/key/v2/server` API on behalf of
 another server and sign the response with their own key. A server may
 query multiple notary servers to ensure that they all report the same
 public keys.
 


This approach is borrowed from the [Perspectives
 Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20170702024706/https://perspectives-project.org/),
 but modified to include the NACL keys and to use JSON instead of XML. It
 has the advantage of avoiding a single trust-root since each server is
 free to pick which notary servers they trust and can corroborate the
 keys returned by a given notary server by querying other servers.


#### Publishing Keys


Homeservers publish their signing keys in a JSON object at
 `/_matrix/key/v2/server`. The response contains a list of
 `verify_keys` that are valid for signing federation requests made by the
 homeserver and for signing events. It contains a list of
 `old_verify_keys` which are only valid for signing events.
 





# GET
/\_matrix/key/v2/server





---


Gets the homeserver’s published signing keys.
 The homeserver may have any number of active keys and may have a
 number of old keys.


Intermediate notary servers should cache a response for half of its
 lifetime to avoid serving a stale response. Originating servers should
 avoid returning responses that expire in less than an hour to avoid
 repeated requests for a certificate that is about to expire. Requesting
 servers should limit how frequently they query for certificates to
 avoid flooding a server with requests.


If the server fails to respond to this request, intermediate notary
 servers should continue to return the last response they received
 from the server so that the signatures of old events can still be
 checked.

Server Keys
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `old_verify_keys` | `{string: [Old Verify Key](#get_matrixkeyv2server_response-200_old-verify-key)}` | The public keys that the server used to use and when it stopped using them. The object’s key is the algorithm and version combined (`ed25519` being the  algorithm and `0ldK3y` being the version in the example below). Together,  this forms the Key ID. The version must have characters matching the regular  expression `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`. |
| `server_name` | `string` | **Required:** DNS name of the homeserver. |
| `signatures` | `{string: {string: string}}` | Digital signatures for this object signed using the `verify_keys`. The signature is calculated using the process described at [Signing JSON](/v1.11/appendices/#signing-json). |

Servers MUST use the lesser of this field and 7 days into the future when  determining if a key is valid. This is to avoid a situation where an attacker  publishes a key which is valid for a significant amount of time without a way  for the homeserver owner to revoke it. |

#### Querying Keys Through Another Server


Servers may query another server’s keys through a notary server. The
 notary server may be another homeserver. The notary server will retrieve
 keys from the queried servers through use of the
 `/_matrix/key/v2/server` API. The notary server will
 additionally sign the response from the queried server before returning
 the results.
 


Notary servers can return keys for servers that are offline or having
 issues serving their own keys by using cached responses. Keys can be
 queried from multiple servers to mitigate against DNS spoofing.





# POST
/\_matrix/key/v2/query





---


Query for keys from multiple servers in a batch format. The receiving (notary)
 server must sign the keys returned by the queried servers.

## Authentication


### Request Authentication


Every HTTP request made by a homeserver is authenticated using public
 key digital signatures. The request method, target and body are signed
 by wrapping them in a JSON object and signing it using the JSON signing
 algorithm. The resulting signatures are added as an Authorization header
 with an auth scheme of `X-Matrix`. Note that the target field should
 include the full path starting with `/_matrix/...`, including the `?`
 and any query parameters if present, but should not include the leading
 `https:`, nor the destination server’s hostname.
 


Step 1 sign JSON:



```
{
    "method": "POST",
    "uri": "/target",
    "origin": "origin.hs.example.com",
    "destination": "destination.hs.example.com",
    "content": <JSON-parsed request body>,
    "signatures": {
        "origin.hs.example.com": {
            "ed25519:key1": "ABCDEF..."
        }
    }
}

```

The server names in the JSON above are the server names for each
 homeserver involved. Delegation from the [server name resolution
 section](#resolving-server-names) above do not affect these - the server
 names from before delegation would take place are used. This same
 condition applies throughout the request signing process.


Step 2 add Authorization header:



```
POST /target HTTP/1.1
Authorization: X-Matrix origin="origin.hs.example.com",destination="destination.hs.example.com",key="ed25519:key1",sig="ABCDEF..."
Content-Type: application/json

<JSON-encoded request body>

```

Example python code:




```
def authorization_headers(origin_name, origin_signing_key,
                          destination_name, request_method, request_target,
                          content=None):
    request_json = {
         "method": request_method,
         "uri": request_target,
         "origin": origin_name,
         "destination": destination_name,
    }

    if content is not None:
        # Assuming content is already parsed as JSON
        request_json["content"] = content

    signed_json = sign_json(request_json, origin_name, origin_signing_key)

    authorization_headers = []

    for key, sig in signed_json["signatures"][origin_name].items():
        authorization_headers.append(bytes(
            "X-Matrix origin=\"%s\",destination=\"%s\",key=\"%s\",sig=\"%s\"" % (
                origin_name, destination_name, key, sig,
            )
        ))

    return ("Authorization", authorization_headers[0])

```


The format of the Authorization header is given in
 [Section 11.4 of RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-11.4). In
 summary, the header begins with authorization scheme `X-Matrix`, followed by one
 or more spaces, followed by a comma-separated list of parameters written as
 name=value pairs. Zero or more spaces and tabs around each comma are allowed.
 The names are case insensitive and order does not matter. The
 values must be enclosed in quotes if they contain characters that are not
 allowed in `token`s, as defined in
 [Section 5.6.2 of RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-5.6.2); if a
 value is a valid `token`, it may or may not be enclosed in quotes. Quoted
 values may include backslash-escaped characters. When parsing the header, the
 recipient must unescape the characters. That is, a backslash-character pair is
 replaced by the character that follows the backslash.
 


For compatibility with older servers, the sender should


* only include one space after `X-Matrix`,
* only use lower-case names,
* avoid using backslashes in parameter values, and
* avoid including whitespace around the commas between name=value pairs.


For compatibility with older servers, the recipient should allow colons to be
 included in values without requiring the value to be enclosed in quotes.


The authorization parameters to include are:


* `origin`: the server name of the sending server. This is the same as the
 `origin` field from JSON described in step 1.
* `destination`: **[Added in `v1.3`]** the server name of the
 receiving
 server. This is the same as the `destination` field from the JSON described
 in step 1. For compatibility with older servers, recipients should accept
 requests without this parameter, but MUST always send it. If this property
 is included, but the value does not match the receiving server’s name, the
 receiving server must deny the request with an HTTP status code 401
 Unauthorized.
* `key`: the ID, including the algorithm name, of the sending server’s key used
 to sign the request.
* `signature`: the signature of the JSON as calculated in step 1.


Unknown parameters are ignored.



**[Changed in `v1.11`]**
 This section used to reference [RFC 7235](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235#section-2.1)
 and [RFC 7230](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-5.6.2), that
 were obsoleted by RFC 9110 without changes to the sections of interest here.
 
### Response Authentication


Responses are authenticated by the TLS server certificate. A homeserver
 should not send a request until it has authenticated the connected
 server to avoid leaking messages to eavesdroppers.


### Client TLS Certificates


Requests are authenticated at the HTTP layer rather than at the TLS
 layer because HTTP services like Matrix are often deployed behind load
 balancers that handle the TLS and these load balancers make it difficult
 to check TLS client certificates.


A homeserver may provide a TLS client certificate and the receiving
 homeserver may check that the client certificate matches the certificate
 of the origin homeserver.


## Transactions


The transfer of EDUs and PDUs between homeservers is performed by an
 exchange of Transaction messages, which are encoded as JSON objects,
 passed over an HTTP PUT request. A Transaction is meaningful only to the
 pair of homeservers that exchanged it; they are not globally-meaningful.


Transactions are limited in size; they can have at most 50 PDUs and 100
 EDUs.





# PUT
/\_matrix/federation/v1/send/{txnId}





---


Push messages representing live activity to another server. The destination name
 will be set to that of the receiving server itself. Each embedded PDU in the
 transaction body will be processed.


The sending server must wait and retry for a 200 OK response before sending a
 transaction with a different `txnId` to the receiving server.


Note that events have a different format depending on the room version - check
 the [room version specification](/v1.11/rooms) for precise event formats.

    },
    "$successful_event:example.org": {}
  }
}

```




## PDUs


Each PDU contains a single Room Event which the origin server wants to
 send to the destination.


The `prev_events` field of a PDU identifies the “parents” of the event,
 and thus establishes a partial ordering on events within the room by
 linking them into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The sending server
 should populate this field with all of the events in the room for which
 it has not yet seen a child - thus demonstrating that the event comes
 after all other known events.


For example, consider a room whose events form the DAG shown below. A
 server creating a new event in this room should populate the new event’s
 `prev_events` field with both `E4` and `E6`, since neither event yet has
 a child:
 



```
E1
^
|
E2 <--- E5
^       ^
|       |
E3      E6
^
|
E4

```

For a full schema of what a PDU looks like, see the [room version
 specification](/v1.11/rooms).


### Checks performed on receipt of a PDU


Whenever a server receives an event from a remote server, the receiving
 server must ensure that the event:


1. Is a valid event, otherwise it is dropped. For an event to be valid, it
 must contain a `room_id`, and it must comply with the event format of
 that [room version](/v1.11/rooms).
2. Passes signature checks, otherwise it is dropped.
3. Passes hash checks, otherwise it is redacted before being processed
 further.
4. Passes authorization rules based on the event’s auth events,
 otherwise it is rejected.
5. Passes authorization rules based on the state before the event,
 otherwise it is rejected.
6. Passes authorization rules based on the current state of the room,
 otherwise it is “soft failed”.


Further details of these checks, and how to handle failures, are
 described below.


The [Signing Events](#signing-events) section has more information on
 which hashes and signatures are expected on events, and how to calculate
 them.


#### Definitions



Required Power Level

A given event type has an associated *required power level*. This is given by
 the current [`m.room.power_levels`](/v1.11/client-server-api/#mroompower_levels)
 event. The event type is either listed explicitly in the `events` section or
 given by either `state_default` or `events_default` depending on if the event
 is a state event or not.



Invite Level, Kick Level, Ban Level, Redact Level

The levels given by the `invite`, `kick`, `ban`, and `redact`
 properties in
 the current [`m.room.power_levels`](/v1.11/client-server-api/#mroompower_levels)
 state. The invite level defaults to 0 if unspecified. The kick level, ban level
 and redact level each default to 50 if unspecified.



Target User

For an [`m.room.member`](/v1.11/client-server-api/#mroommember) state event, the
 user given by the `state_key` of the event.





Some [room versions](/v1.11/rooms) accept power level values to be represented as
 strings rather than integers. This is strictly for backwards compatibility.
 A homeserver should take reasonable precautions to prevent users from sending
 new power level events with string values (eg: by rejecting the API request),
 and must never populate the default power levels in a room as string values.


See the [room version specification](/v1.11/rooms) for more information.



#### Authorization rules


The rules governing whether an event is authorized depends on a set of
 state. A given event is checked multiple times against different sets of
 state, as specified above. Each room version can have a different
 algorithm for how the rules work, and which rules are applied. For more
 detailed information, please see the [room version
 specification](/v1.11/rooms).


##### Auth events selection


The `auth_events` field of a PDU identifies the set of events which give
 the sender permission to send the event. The `auth_events` for the
 `m.room.create` event in a room is empty; for other events, it should be
 the following subset of the room state:
 


* The `m.room.create` event.
* The current `m.room.power_levels` event, if any.
* The sender’s current `m.room.member` event, if any.
* If type is `m.room.member`:


	+ The target’s current `m.room.member` event, if any.
	+ If `membership` is `join` or `invite`, the current
	 `m.room.join_rules` event, if any.
	+ If membership is `invite` and `content` contains a
	 `third_party_invite` property, the current
	 `m.room.third_party_invite` event with `state_key` matching
	 `content.third_party_invite.signed.token`, if any.
	+ If `content.join_authorised_via_users_server` is present,
	 and the [room version supports restricted rooms](/v1.11/rooms/#feature-matrix),
	 then the `m.room.member` event with `state_key` matching
	 `content.join_authorised_via_users_server`.


#### Rejection


If an event is rejected it should neither be relayed to clients nor be
 included as a prev event in any new events generated by the server.
 Subsequent events from other servers that reference rejected events
 should be allowed if they still pass the auth rules. The state used in
 the checks should be calculated as normal, except not updating with the
 rejected event where it is a state event.


If an event in an incoming transaction is rejected, this should not
 cause the transaction request to be responded to with an error response.



 This means that events may be included in the room DAG even though they
 should be rejected.
 

 This is in contrast to redacted events which can still affect the state
 of the room. For example, a redacted `join` event will still result in
 the user being considered joined.
 
#### Soft failure



It is important that we prevent users from evading bans (or other power
 restrictions) by creating events which reference old parts of the DAG.
 For example, a banned user could continue to send messages to a room by
 having their server send events which reference the event before they
 were banned. Note that such events are entirely valid, and we cannot
 simply reject them, as it is impossible to distinguish such an event
 from a legitimate one which has been delayed. We must therefore accept
 such events and let them participate in state resolution and the
 federation protocol as normal. However, servers may choose not to send
 such events on to their clients, so that end users won’t actually see
 the events.


When this happens it is often fairly obvious to servers, as they can see
 that the new event doesn’t actually pass auth based on the “current
 state” (i.e. the resolved state across all forward extremities). While
 the event is technically valid, the server can choose to not notify
 clients about the new event.


This discourages servers from sending events that evade bans etc. in
 this way, as end users won’t actually see the events.



When the homeserver receives a new event over federation it should also
 check whether the event passes auth checks based on the current state of
 the room (as well as based on the state at the event). If the event does
 not pass the auth checks based on the *current state* of the room (but
 does pass the auth checks based on the state at that event) it should be
 “soft failed”.


When an event is “soft failed” it should not be relayed to the client
 nor be referenced by new events created by the homeserver (i.e. they
 should not be added to the server’s list of forward extremities of the
 room). Soft failed events are otherwise handled as usual.



 Soft failed events participate in state resolution as normal if further
 events are received which reference it. It is the job of the state
 resolution algorithm to ensure that malicious events cannot be injected
 into the room state via this mechanism.
 

 Because soft failed state events participate in state resolution as
 normal, it is possible for such events to appear in the current state of
 the room. In that case the client should be told about the soft failed
 event in the usual way (e.g. by sending it down in the `state` section
 of a sync response).
 

 A soft failed event should be returned in response to federation
 requests where appropriate (e.g. in `/event/<event_id>`). Note that soft
 failed events are returned in `/backfill` and `/get_missing_events`
 responses only if the requests include events referencing the soft
 failed events.
 
Example


As an example consider the event graph:



```
  A
 /
B

```

where `B` is a ban of a user `X`. If the user `X` tries to set the topic
 by sending an event `C` while evading the ban:



```
  A
 / \
B   C

```

servers that receive `C` after `B` should soft fail event `C`, and so
 will neither relay `C` to its clients nor send any events referencing
 `C`.
 


If later another server sends an event `D` that references both `B` and
 `C` (this can happen if it received `C` before `B`):
 



```
  A
 / \
B   C
 \ /
  D

```

then servers will handle `D` as normal. `D` is sent to the servers'
 clients (assuming `D` passes auth checks). The state at `D` may resolve
 to a state that includes `C`, in which case clients should also to be
 told that the state has changed to include `C`. (*Note*: This depends on
 the exact state resolution algorithm used. In the original version of
 the algorithm `C` would be in the resolved state, whereas in latter
 versions the algorithm tries to prioritise the ban over the topic
 change.)


Note that this is essentially equivalent to the situation where one
 server doesn’t receive `C` at all, and so asks another server for the
 state of the `C` branch.


Let’s go back to the graph before `D` was sent:



```
  A
 / \
B   C

```

If all the servers in the room saw `B` before `C` and so soft fail `C`,
 then any new event `D'` will not reference `C`:



```
  A
 / \
B   C
|
D'

```

#### Retrieving event authorization information


The homeserver may be missing event authorization information, or wish
 to check with other servers to ensure it is receiving the correct auth
 chain. These APIs give the homeserver an avenue for getting the
 information it needs.

## Examples




```

  "content": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "edu_type": "m.presence"
}

```




## Room State Resolution


The *state* of a room is a map of `(event_type, state_key)` to
 `event_id`. Each room starts with an empty state, and each state event
 which is accepted into the room updates the state of that room.
 


Where each event has a single `prev_event`, it is clear what the state
 of the room after each event should be. However, when two branches in
 the event graph merge, the state of those branches might differ, so a
 *state resolution* algorithm must be used to determine the resultant
 state.
 


For example, consider the following event graph (where the oldest event,
 E0, is at the top):



```
  E0
  |
  E1
 /  \
E2  E4
|    |
E3   |
 \  /
  E5

```

Suppose E3 and E4 are both `m.room.name` events which set the name of
 the room. What should the name of the room be at E5?


The algorithm to be used for state resolution depends on the room
 version. For a description of each room version’s algorithm, please see
 the [room version specification](/v1.11/rooms).


## Backfilling and retrieving missing events


Once a homeserver has joined a room, it receives all the events emitted
 by other homeservers in that room, and is thus aware of the entire
 history of the room from that moment onwards. Since users in that room
 are able to request the history by the `/messages` client API endpoint,
 it’s possible that they might step backwards far enough into history
 before the homeserver itself was a member of that room.


To cover this case, the federation API provides a server-to-server
 analog of the `/messages` client API, allowing one homeserver to fetch
 history from another. This is the `/backfill` API.


To request more history, the requesting homeserver picks another
 homeserver that it thinks may have more (most likely this should be a
 homeserver for some of the existing users in the room at the earliest
 point in history it has currently), and makes a `/backfill` request.


Similar to backfilling a room’s history, a server may not have all the
 events in the graph. That server may use the `/get_missing_events` API
 to acquire the events it is missing.





# GET
/\_matrix/federation/v1/backfill/{roomId}





---


Retrieves a sliding-window history of previous PDUs that occurred in the given room.

## Retrieving events


In some circumstances, a homeserver may be missing a particular event or
 information about the room which cannot be easily determined from
 backfilling. These APIs provide homeservers with the option of getting
 events and the state of the room at a given point in the timeline.

# GET
/\_matrix/federation/v1/timestamp\_to\_event/{roomId}





---


**Added in `v1.6`**


Get the ID of the event closest to the given timestamp, in the
 direction specified by the `dir` parameter.


This is primarily used when handling the corresponding
 [client-server
 endpoint](/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidtimestamp_to_event)
 when the server does not have all of the room history, and does not
 have an event suitably close to the requested timestamp.
 


The heuristics for deciding when to ask another homeserver for a closer
 event if your homeserver doesn’t have something close, are left up to
 the homeserver implementation, although the heuristics will probably be
 based on whether the closest event is a forward/backward extremity
 indicating it’s next to a gap of events which are potentially closer.


A good heuristic for which servers to try first is to sort by servers
 that have been in the room the longest because they’re most likely to
 have anything we ask about.


After the local homeserver receives the response, it should determine,
 using the `origin_server_ts` property, whether the returned event is
 closer to the requested timestamp than the closest event that it could
 find locally. If so, it should try to backfill this event via the
 [`/event/{event_id}`](#get_matrixfederationv1eventeventid) endpoint so
 that it is available to for a client to query.

## Joining Rooms


When a new user wishes to join a room that the user’s homeserver already
 knows about, the homeserver can immediately determine if this is
 allowable by inspecting the state of the room. If it is acceptable, it
 can generate, sign, and emit a new `m.room.member` state event adding
 the user into that room. When the homeserver does not yet know about the
 room it cannot do this directly. Instead, it must take a longer
 multi-stage handshaking process by which it first selects a remote
 homeserver which is already participating in that room, and use it to
 assist in the joining process. This is the remote join handshake.


This handshake involves the homeserver of the new member wishing to join
 (referred to here as the “joining” server), the directory server hosting
 the room alias the user is requesting to join with, and a homeserver
 where existing room members are already present (referred to as the
 “resident” server).


In summary, the remote join handshake consists of the joining server
 querying the directory server for information about the room alias;
 receiving a room ID and a list of join candidates. The joining server
 then requests information about the room from one of the residents. It
 uses this information to construct an `m.room.member` event which it
 finally sends to a resident server.


Conceptually these are three different roles of homeserver. In practice
 the directory server is likely to be resident in the room, and so may be
 selected by the joining server to be the assisting resident. Likewise,
 it is likely that the joining server picks the same candidate resident
 for both phases of event construction, though in principle any valid
 candidate may be used at each time. Thus, any join handshake can
 potentially involve anywhere from two to four homeservers, though most
 in practice will use just two.

```

The first part of the handshake usually involves using the directory
 server to request the room ID and join candidates through the
 [`/query/directory`](/v1.11/server-server-api/#get_matrixfederationv1querydirectory) API
 endpoint. In the case of a new user joining a
 room as a result of a received invite, the joining user’s homeserver
 could optimise this step away by picking the origin server of that
 invite message as the join candidate. However, the joining server should
 be aware that the origin server of the invite might since have left the
 room, so should be prepared to fall back on the regular join flow if
 this optimisation fails.
 


Once the joining server has the room ID and the join candidates, it then
 needs to obtain enough information about the room to fill in the
 required fields of the `m.room.member` event. It obtains this by
 selecting a resident from the candidate list, and using the
 `GET /make_join` endpoint. The resident server will then reply with
 enough information for the joining server to fill in the event.
 


The joining server is expected to add or replace the `origin`,
 `origin_server_ts`, and `event_id` on the templated event received by
 the resident server. This event is then signed by the joining server.
 


To complete the join handshake, the joining server submits this new event
 to the resident server it used for `GET /make_join`, using the `PUT /send_join`
 endpoint.


The resident homeserver then adds its signature to this event and
 accepts it into the room’s event graph. The joining server receives
 the full set of state for the newly-joined room as well as the freshly
 signed membership event. The resident server must also send the event
 to other servers participating in the room.

| `400` | The request is invalid, the room the server is attempting  to join has a version that is not listed in the `ver`  parameters, or the server was unable to validate  [restricted room conditions](#restricted-rooms).   The error should be passed through to clients so that they  may give better feedback to users. New in `v1.2`, the following error conditions might happen: If the room is [restricted](/v1.11/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms)  and none of the conditions can be validated by the server then  the `errcode` `M_UNABLE_TO_AUTHORISE_JOIN` must be used. This can  happen if the server does not know about any of the rooms listed  as conditions, for example. `M_UNABLE_TO_GRANT_JOIN` is returned to denote that a different  server should be attempted for the join. This is typically because  the resident server can see that the joining user satisfies one or  more conditions, such as in the case of  [restricted rooms](/v1.11/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms), but the  resident server would be unable to meet the auth rules governing  `join_authorised_via_users_server` on the resulting  `m.room.member`  event. |

**Note:**
 This API is nearly identical to the v1 API with the
 exception of the response format being fixed.


This endpoint is preferred over the v1 API as it provides
 a more standardised response format. Senders which receive
 a 400, 404, or other status code which indicates this endpoint
 is not available should retry using the v1 API instead.


Submits a signed join event to the resident server for it
 to accept it into the room’s graph. Note that events have
 a different format depending on the room version - check
 the [room version specification](/v1.11/rooms) for precise event formats.
 **The request and response body here describe the common

## Request


### Request parameters




path parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eventId` | `string` | **Required:** The event ID for the join event. |
| `roomId` | `string` | **Required:** The room ID that is about to be joined. |




query parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `omit_members` | `boolean` | If `true`, indicates that that calling server can accept a reduced  response, in which membership events are omitted from `state` and  redundant events are omitted from `auth_chain`. If the room to be joined has no `m.room.name` nor  `m.room.canonical_alias` events in its current state, the resident  server should determine the room members who would be included in  the `m.heroes` property of the room summary as defined in the  [Client-Server /sync  response](/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync). The resident  server should include these members’ membership events in the  response `state` field, and include the auth chains for these  membership events in the response `auth_chain` field.   **Added in `v1.6`** |


### Request body




| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | `[Membership Event Content](#put_matrixfederationv2send_joinroomideventid_request_membership-event-content)` | **Required:** The content of the event. |
| `origin` | `string` | **Required:** The name of the joining homeserver. |
| `origin_server_ts` | `integer` | **Required:** A timestamp added by the joining homeserver. |
| `sender` | `string` | **Required:** The user ID of the joining member. |
| `state_key` | `string` | **Required:** The user ID of the joining member. |
| `type` | `string` | **Required:** The value `m.room.member`. |




Membership Event Content
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `join_authorised_via_users_server` | `string` | Required if the room is [restricted](/v1.11/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms)  and is joining through one of the conditions available. If the  user is responding to an invite, this is not required. An arbitrary user ID belonging to the resident server in  the room being joined that is able to issue invites to other  users. This is used in later validation of the auth rules for  the `m.room.member` event. The resident server which owns the provided user ID must have a  valid signature on the event. If the resident server is receiving  the `/send_join` request, the signature must be added before sending  or persisting the event to other servers. **Added in `v1.2`** |
| `membership` | `string` | **Required:** The value `join`. |


### Request body example

## Responses




| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | The join event has been accepted into the room. |
| `400` | The request is invalid in some way. The error should be passed through to clients so that they  may give better feedback to users. New in `v1.2`, the following error conditions might happen: If the room is [restricted](/v1.11/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms)  and none of the conditions can be validated by the server then  the `errcode` `M_UNABLE_TO_AUTHORISE_JOIN` must be used. This can  happen if the server does not know about any of the rooms listed  as conditions, for example. `M_UNABLE_TO_GRANT_JOIN` is returned to denote that a different  server should be attempted for the join. This is typically because  the resident server can see that the joining user satisfies one or  more conditions, such as in the case of  [restricted rooms](/v1.11/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms), but the  resident server would be unable to meet the auth rules governing  `join_authorised_via_users_server` on the resulting  `m.room.member`  event. |
| `403` | The room that the joining server is attempting to join does not permit the user  to join. |


### 200 response




| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth_chain` | `[PDU]` | **Required:**  All events in the auth chain for the new join event, as well  as those in the auth chains for any events returned in  `state`.   If the `omit_members` query parameter was set to `true`, then  any events that are returned in `state` may be omitted from  `auth_chain`, whether or not membership events are omitted  from `state`.   Note that events have a different format depending on the room version - check the  [room version specification](/v1.11/rooms) for precise event formats.    **Changed in `v1.6`:**   reworded to include only consider state events returned in  `state`, and to allow elision of redundant events. |
| `event` | `SignedMembershipEvent` | The membership event sent to other servers by the resident server including a signature  from the resident server. Required if the room is [restricted](/v1.11/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms)  and the joining user is authorised by one of the conditions.  **Added in `v1.2`** |
| `members_omitted` | `boolean` | `true` if `m.room.member` events have been omitted from  `state`.  **Added in `v1.6`** |
| `origin` | `string` | **Required:** The resident server’s DNS name. |
| `servers_in_room` | `[string]` | **Required** if `members_omitted` is true. A list of the servers active in the room (ie, those with joined members) before the join.   **Added in `v1.6`** |
| `state` | `[PDU]` | **Required:**  The resolved current room state prior to the join event. If the request had `omit_members` set to `true`, events of  type `m.room.member` may be omitted from the response to  reduce the size of the response. If this is done,  `members_omitted` must be set to `true`.    **Changed in `v1.6`:**   permit omission of membership events. |

### Restricted rooms


Restricted rooms are described in detail in the
 [client-server API](/v1.11/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms) and are available
 in room versions [which support restricted join rules](/v1.11/rooms/#feature-matrix).
 


A resident server processing a request to join a restricted room must
 ensure that the joining server satisfies at least one of the conditions
 specified by `m.room.join_rules`. If no conditions are available, or none
 match the required schema, then the joining server is considered to have
 failed all conditions.


The resident server uses a 400 `M_UNABLE_TO_AUTHORISE_JOIN` error on
 `/make_join` and `/send_join` to denote that the resident server is unable
 to validate any of the conditions, usually because the resident server
 does not have state information about rooms required by the conditions.
 


The resident server uses a 400 `M_UNABLE_TO_GRANT_JOIN` error on `/make_join`
 and `/send_join` to denote that the joining server should try a different
 server. This is typically because the resident server can see that the
 joining user satisfies one of the conditions, though the resident server
 would be unable to meet the auth rules governing `join_authorised_via_users_server`
 on the resulting `m.room.member` event.


If the joining server fails all conditions then a 403 `M_FORBIDDEN` error
 is used by the resident server.


## Knocking upon a room


Rooms can permit knocking through the join rules, and if permitted this
 gives users a way to request to join (be invited) to the room. Users who
 knock on a room where the server is already a resident of the room can
 just send the knock event directly without using this process, however
 much like [joining rooms](/v1.11/server-server-api/#joining-rooms) the server
 must handshake their way into having the knock sent on its behalf.


The handshake is largely the same as the joining rooms handshake, where
 instead of a “joining server” there is a “knocking server”, and the APIs
 to be called are different (`/make_knock` and `/send_knock`).


Servers can retract knocks over federation by leaving the room, as described
 below for rejecting invites.

## Inviting to a room


When a user on a given homeserver invites another user on the same
 homeserver, the homeserver may sign the membership event itself and skip
 the process defined here. However, when a user invites another user on a
 different homeserver, a request to that homeserver to have the event
 signed and verified must be made.


Note that invites are used to indicate that knocks were accepted. As such,
 receiving servers should be prepared to manually link up a previous knock
 to an invite if the invite event does not directly reference the knock.





# PUT
/\_matrix/federation/v1/invite/{roomId}/{eventId}





---


Invites a remote user to a room. Once the event has been signed by both the inviting
 homeserver and the invited homeserver, it can be sent to all of the servers in the
 room by the inviting homeserver.


Servers should prefer to use the v2 API for invites instead of the v1 API. Servers
 which receive a v1 invite request must assume that the room version is either `"1"`
 or `"2"`.


Note that events have a different format depending on the room version - check the
 [room version specification](/v1.11/rooms) for precise event formats. **The request and
 response
 bodies here describe the common event fields in more detail and may be missing other
 required fields for a PDU.**

**Note:**
 This API is nearly identical to the v1 API with the exception of the request
 body being different, and the response format fixed.


Invites a remote user to a room. Once the event has been signed by both the inviting
 homeserver and the invited homeserver, it can be sent to all of the servers in the
 room by the inviting homeserver.


This endpoint is preferred over the v1 API as it is more useful for servers. Senders
 which receive a 400 or 404 response to this endpoint should retry using the v1
 API as the server may be older, if the room version is “1” or “2”.


Note that events have a different format depending on the room version - check the
 [room version specification](/v1.11/rooms) for precise event formats. **The request and
 response

## Leaving Rooms (Rejecting Invites)


Normally homeservers can send appropriate `m.room.member` events to have
 users leave the room, to reject local invites, or to retract a knock.
 Remote invites/knocks from other homeservers do not involve the server in the
 graph and therefore need another approach to reject the invite. Joining
 the room and promptly leaving is not recommended as clients and servers will
 interpret that as accepting the invite, then leaving the room rather
 than rejecting the invite.


Similar to the [Joining Rooms](#joining-rooms) handshake, the server
 which wishes to leave the room starts with sending a `/make_leave`
 request to a resident server. In the case of rejecting invites, the
 resident server may be the server which sent the invite. After receiving
 a template event from `/make_leave`, the leaving server signs the event
 and replaces the `event_id` with its own. This is then sent to the
 resident server via `/send_leave`. The resident server will then send
 the event to other servers in the room.

## Third-party invites



 More information about third-party invites is available in the
 [Client-Server API](/v1.11/client-server-api) under
 the Third-party Invites module.
 
When a user wants to invite another user in a room but doesn’t know the
 Matrix ID to invite, they can do so using a third-party identifier (e.g.
 an e-mail or a phone number).


This identifier and its bindings to Matrix IDs are verified by an
 identity server implementing the [Identity Service
 API](/v1.11/identity-service-api).


### Cases where an association exists for a
 third-party identifier


If the third-party identifier is already bound to a Matrix ID, a lookup
 request on the identity server will return it. The invite is then
 processed by the inviting homeserver as a standard `m.room.member`
 invite event. This is the simplest case.


### Cases where an association doesn’t
 exist for a third-party identifier


If the third-party identifier isn’t bound to any Matrix ID, the inviting
 homeserver will request the identity server to store an invite for this
 identifier and to deliver it to whoever binds it to its Matrix ID. It
 will also send an `m.room.third_party_invite` event in the room to
 specify a display name, a token and public keys the identity server
 provided as a response to the invite storage request.


When a third-party identifier with pending invites gets bound to a
 Matrix ID, the identity server will send a POST request to the ID’s
 homeserver as described in the [Invitation
 Storage](/v1.11/identity-service-api#invitation-storage)
 section of the Identity Service API.


The following process applies for each invite sent by the identity
 server:


The invited homeserver will create an `m.room.member` invite event
 containing a special `third_party_invite` section containing the token
 and a signed object, both provided by the identity server.


If the invited homeserver is in the room the invite came from, it can
 auth the event and send it.


However, if the invited homeserver isn’t in the room the invite came
 from, it will need to request the room’s homeserver to auth the event.





# PUT

#### Verifying the invite


When a homeserver receives an `m.room.member` invite event for a room
 it’s in with a `third_party_invite` object, it must verify that the
 association between the third-party identifier initially invited to the
 room and the Matrix ID that claims to be bound to it has been verified
 without having to rely on a third-party server.


To do so, it will fetch from the room’s state events the
 `m.room.third_party_invite` event for which the state key matches with
 the value for the `token` key in the `third_party_invite` object from
 the `m.room.member` event’s content to fetch the public keys initially
 delivered by the identity server that stored the invite.
 


It will then use these keys to verify that the `signed` object (in the
 `third_party_invite` object from the `m.room.member` event’s content)
 was signed by the same identity server.
 


Since this `signed` object can only be delivered once in the POST
 request emitted by the identity server upon binding between the
 third-party identifier and the Matrix ID, and contains the invited
 user’s Matrix ID and the token delivered when the invite was stored,
 this verification will prove that the `m.room.member` invite event comes
 from the user owning the invited third-party identifier.


## Public Room Directory


To complement the [Client-Server
 API](/v1.11/client-server-api)’s room directory,
 homeservers need a way to query the public rooms for another server.
 This can be done by making a request to the `/publicRooms` endpoint for
 the server the room directory should be retrieved for.





# GET
/\_matrix/federation/v1/publicRooms





---


Gets all the public rooms for the homeserver. This should not return
 rooms that are listed on another homeserver’s directory, just those
 listed on the receiving homeserver’s directory.

## Spaces


To complement the [Client-Server API’s Spaces module](/v1.11/client-server-api/#spaces),
 homeservers need a way to query information about spaces from other servers.





# GET
/\_matrix/federation/v1/hierarchy/{roomId}





---


**Added in `v1.2`**


Federation version of the Client-Server [`GET /hierarchy`](/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidhierarchy)
 endpoint. Unlike the Client-Server API version, this endpoint does not paginate. Instead, all
 the space-room’s children the requesting server could feasibly peek/join are returned. The
 requesting server is responsible for filtering the results further down for the user’s request.


Only [`m.space.child`](/v1.11/client-server-api/#mspacechild) state events of the
 room are considered. Invalid child
 rooms and parent events are not covered by this endpoint.


Responses to this endpoint should be cached for a period of time.

## Typing Notifications


When a server’s users send typing notifications, those notifications
 need to be sent to other servers in the room so their users are aware of
 the same state. Receiving servers should verify that the user is in the
 room, and is a user belonging to the sending server.

  },
  "edu_type": "m.typing"
}

```




## Presence


The server API for presence is based entirely on exchange of the
 following EDUs. There are no PDUs or Federation Queries involved.


Servers should only send presence updates for users that the receiving
 server would be interested in. Such as the receiving server sharing a
 room with a given user.





# `m.presence`





---


An EDU representing presence updates for users of the sending homeserver.




m.presence
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | `[Presence Update](#definition-mpresence_presence-update)` | **Required:** The presence updates and requests. |
| `edu_type` | `string` | **Required:** The string `m.presence` One of: `[m.presence]`. |




Presence Update

| --- | --- | --- |
| `push` | `[[User Presence Update](#definition-mpresence_user-presence-update)]` | **Required:** A list of presence updates that the receiving server is likely  to be interested in. |




User Presence Update
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `currently_active` | `boolean` | True if the user is likely to be interacting with their  client. This may be indicated by the user having a  `last_active_ago` within the last few minutes. Defaults  to false. |
| `last_active_ago` | `integer` | **Required:** The number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the user  last did something. |
| `presence` | `string` | **Required:** The presence of the user.One of:  `[offline, unavailable, online]`. |

        "user_id": "@john:matrix.org"
      }
    ]
  },
  "edu_type": "m.presence"
}

```




## Receipts


Receipts are EDUs used to communicate a marker for a given event.
 Currently the only kind of receipt supported is a “read receipt”, or
 where in the event graph the user has read up to.


Read receipts for events that a user sent do not need to be sent. It is
 implied that by sending the event the user has read up to the event.





# `m.receipt`

An EDU representing receipt updates for users of the sending homeserver.
 When receiving receipts, the server should only update entries that are
 listed in the EDU. Receipts previously received that do not appear in the
 EDU should not be removed or otherwise manipulated.




m.receipt

| `content` | `{[Room ID](/v1.11/appendices#room-ids): [Room Receipts](#definition-mreceipt_room-receipts)}` | **Required:** Receipts for a particular room. The string key is the room ID for  which the receipts under it belong. |
| `edu_type` | `string` | **Required:** The string `m.receipt` One of: `[m.receipt]`. |




Room Receipts
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `m.read` | `{[User ID](/v1.11/appendices#user-identifiers): [User Read Receipt](#definition-mreceipt_user-read-receipt)}` | **Required:** Read receipts for users in the room. The string key is the user  ID the receipt belongs to. |

| `ts` | `integer` | **Required:** A POSIX timestamp in milliseconds for when the user read  the event specified in the read receipt. |


## Examples




```

    }
  },
  "edu_type": "m.receipt"
}

```




## Querying for information


Queries are a way to retrieve information from a homeserver about a
 resource, such as a user or room. The endpoints here are often called in
 conjunction with a request from a client on the client-server API in
 order to complete the call.


There are several types of queries that can be made. The generic
 endpoint to represent all queries is described first, followed by the
 more specific queries that can be made.





# GET
/\_matrix/federation/v1/query/directory





---


Performs a query to get the mapped room ID and list of resident homeservers in
 the room for a given room alias. Homeservers should only query room aliases
 that belong to the target server (identified by the DNS Name in the alias).


Servers may wish to cache the response to this query to avoid requesting the
 information too often.

## Device Management


Details of a user’s devices must be efficiently published to other users
 and kept up-to-date. This is critical for reliable end-to-end
 encryption, in order for users to know which devices are participating
 in a room. It’s also required for to-device messaging to work. This
 section is intended to complement the [Device Management
 module](/v1.11/client-server-api#device-management)
 of the Client-Server API.


Matrix currently uses a custom pubsub system for synchronising
 information about the list of devices for a given user over federation.
 When a server wishes to determine a remote user’s device list for the
 first time, it should populate a local cache from the result of a
 `/user/keys/query` API on the remote server. However, subsequent updates
 to the cache should be applied by consuming `m.device_list_update` EDUs.
 Each new `m.device_list_update` EDU describes an incremental change to
 one device for a given user which should replace any existing entry in
 the local server’s cache of that device list. Servers must send
 `m.device_list_update` EDUs to all the servers who share a room with a
 given local user, and must be sent whenever that user’s device list
 changes (i.e. for new or deleted devices, when that user joins a room
 which contains servers which are not already receiving updates for that
 user’s device list, or changes in device information such as the
 device’s human-readable name).
 


Servers send `m.device_list_update` EDUs in a sequence per origin user,
 each with a unique `stream_id`. They also include a pointer to the most
 recent previous EDU(s) that this update is relative to in the `prev_id`
 field. To simplify implementation for clustered servers which could send
 multiple EDUs at the same time, the `prev_id` field should include all
 `m.device_list_update` EDUs which have not been yet been referenced in a
 EDU. If EDUs are emitted in series by a server, there should only ever
 be one `prev_id` in the EDU.
 


This forms a simple directed acyclic graph of `m.device_list_update`
 EDUs, showing which EDUs a server needs to have received in order to
 apply an update to its local copy of the remote user’s device list. If a
 server receives an EDU which refers to a `prev_id` it does not
 recognise, it must resynchronise its list by calling the
 `/user/keys/query API` and resume the process. The response contains a
 `stream_id` which should be used to correlate with subsequent
 `m.device_list_update` EDUs.

## End-to-End Encryption


This section complements the [End-to-End Encryption
 module](/v1.11/client-server-api#end-to-end-encryption)
 of the Client-Server API. For detailed information about end-to-end
 encryption, please see that module.


The APIs defined here are designed to be able to proxy much of the
 client’s request through to federation, and have the response also be
 proxied through to the client.

## Send-to-device messaging


The server API for send-to-device messaging is based on the
 `m.direct_to_device` EDU. There are no PDUs or Federation Queries
 involved.
 


Each send-to-device message should be sent to the destination server
 using the following EDU:





# `m.direct_to_device`





---


An EDU that lets servers push send events directly to a specific device on
 a remote server - for instance, to maintain an Olm E2E encrypted message channel
 between a local and remote device.

## Content Repository


Attachments to events (images, files, etc) are uploaded to a homeserver
 via the Content Repository described in the [Client-Server
 API](/v1.11/client-server-api/#content-repository). When a server wishes
 to serve content originating from a remote server, it needs to ask the
 remote server for the media.


Servers MUST use the server described in the [Matrix
 Content URI](/v1.11/client-server-api/#matrix-content-mxc-uris).
 Formatted as `mxc://{ServerName}/{MediaID}`, servers MUST download the media from
 `ServerName` using the below endpoints.
 



**[Changed in `v1.11`]** Servers were previously advised to use the
 `/_matrix/media/*`
 endpoints described by the [Content Repository module in
 the Client-Server API](/v1.11/client-server-api/#content-repository),
 however, those endpoints have been deprecated. New endpoints are introduced which
 require authentication. Naturally, as a server is not a user, they cannot provide
 the required access token to those endpoints. Instead, servers MUST try the endpoints
 described below before falling back to the deprecated `/_matrix/media/*` endpoints
 when they receive a `404 M_UNRECOGNIZED` error. When falling back, servers MUST
 be sure to set `allow_remote` to `false`.

## Server Access Control Lists (ACLs)


Server ACLs and their purpose are described in the [Server
 ACLs](/v1.11/client-server-api#server-access-control-lists-acls-for-rooms)
 section of the Client-Server API.


When a remote server makes a request, it MUST be verified to be allowed
 by the server ACLs. If the server is denied access to a room, the
 receiving server MUST reply with a 403 HTTP status code and an `errcode`
 of `M_FORBIDDEN`.


The following endpoint prefixes MUST be protected:


* `/_matrix/federation/v1/send` (on a per-PDU basis)
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/make_join`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/make_leave`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/send_join`
* `/_matrix/federation/v2/send_join`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/send_leave`
* `/_matrix/federation/v2/send_leave`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/invite`
* `/_matrix/federation/v2/invite`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/make_knock`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/send_knock`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/state`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/state_ids`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/backfill`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/event_auth`
* `/_matrix/federation/v1/get_missing_events`


## Signing Events


Signing events is complicated by the fact that servers can choose to
 redact non-essential parts of an event.


### Adding hashes and signatures to outgoing events


Before signing the event, the *content hash* of the event is calculated
 as described below. The hash is encoded using [Unpadded
 Base64](/v1.11/appendices#unpadded-base64) and stored in the event
 object, in a `hashes` object, under a `sha256` key.


The event object is then *redacted*, following the [redaction
 algorithm](/v1.11/client-server-api#redactions).
 Finally it is signed as described in [Signing
 JSON](/v1.11/appendices#signing-json), using the server’s signing key
 (see also [Retrieving server keys](#retrieving-server-keys)).


The signature is then copied back to the original event object.


For an example of a signed event, see the [room version
 specification](/v1.11/rooms).


### Validating hashes and signatures on received events


When a server receives an event over federation from another server, the
 receiving server should check the hashes and signatures on that event.


First the signature is checked. The event is redacted following the
 [redaction
 algorithm](/v1.11/client-server-api#redactions), and
 the resultant object is checked for a signature from the originating
 server, following the algorithm described in [Checking for a
 signature](/v1.11/appendices#checking-for-a-signature). Note that this
 step should succeed whether we have been sent the full event or a
 redacted copy.
 


The signatures expected on an event are:


* The `sender`’s server, unless the invite was created as a result of
 3rd party invite. The sender must already match the 3rd party
 invite, and the server which actually sends the event may be a
 different server.
* For room versions 1 and 2, the server which created the `event_id`.
 Other room versions do not track the `event_id` over federation and
 therefore do not need a signature from those servers.


If the signature is found to be valid, the expected content hash is
 calculated as described below. The content hash in the `hashes` property
 of the received event is base64-decoded, and the two are compared for
 equality.


If the hash check fails, then it is assumed that this is because we have
 only been given a redacted version of the event. To enforce this, the
 receiving server should use the redacted copy it calculated rather than
 the full copy it received.


### Calculating the reference hash for an event


The *reference hash* of an event covers the essential fields of an
 event, including content hashes. It is used for event identifiers in
 some room versions. See the [room version
 specification](/v1.11/rooms) for more information. It is
 calculated as follows.


1. The event is put through the redaction algorithm.
2. The `signatures` and `unsigned` properties are removed
 from the event, if present.
3. The event is converted into [Canonical
 JSON](/v1.11/appendices#canonical-json).
4. A sha256 hash is calculated on the resulting JSON object.


### Calculating the content hash for an event


The *content hash* of an event covers the complete event including the
 *unredacted* contents. It is calculated as follows.
 


First, any existing `unsigned`, `signature`, and `hashes` members are
 removed. The resulting object is then encoded as [Canonical
 JSON](/v1.11/appendices#canonical-json), and the JSON is hashed using
 SHA-256.


### Example code




```
def hash_and_sign_event(event_object, signing_key, signing_name):
    # First we need to hash the event object.
    content_hash = compute_content_hash(event_object)
    event_object["hashes"] = {"sha256": encode_unpadded_base64(content_hash)}

    # Strip all the keys that would be removed if the event was redacted.
    # The hashes are not stripped and cover all the keys in the event.
    # This means that we can tell if any of the non-essential keys are
    # modified or removed.
    stripped_object = strip_non_essential_keys(event_object)

    # Sign the stripped JSON object. The signature only covers the
    # essential keys and the hashes. This means that we can check the
    # signature even if the event is redacted.
    signed_object = sign_json(stripped_object, signing_key, signing_name)

    # Copy the signatures from the stripped event to the original event.
    event_object["signatures"] = signed_object["signatures"]

def compute_content_hash(event_object):
    # take a copy of the event before we remove any keys.
    event_object = dict(event_object)

    # Keys under "unsigned" can be modified by other servers.
    # They are useful for conveying information like the age of an
    # event that will change in transit.
    # Since they can be modified we need to exclude them from the hash.
    event_object.pop("unsigned", None)

    # Signatures will depend on the current value of the "hashes" key.
    # We cannot add new hashes without invalidating existing signatures.
    event_object.pop("signatures", None)

    # The "hashes" key might contain multiple algorithms if we decide to
    # migrate away from SHA-2. We don't want to include an existing hash
    # output in our hash so we exclude the "hashes" dict from the hash.
    event_object.pop("hashes", None)

    # Encode the JSON using a canonical encoding so that we get the same
    # bytes on every server for the same JSON object.
    event_json_bytes = encode_canonical_json(event_object)

    return hashlib.sha256(event_json_bytes)

```


## Security considerations


When a domain’s ownership changes, the new controller of the domain can
 masquerade as the previous owner, receiving messages (similarly to
 email) and request past messages from other servers. In the future,
 proposals like
 [MSC1228](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/1228) will
 address this issue.
